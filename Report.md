### Theory Review
**IC Package**-*Integrated circuits are put into protective packages to allow easy handling and assembly onto printed circuit boards and to protect the devices from damage.Exp:

**Wire Bond**-*Wire bonding is the process of creating electrical interconnections between semiconductors (or other integrated circuits) and silicon chips using bonding wires, which are fine wires made of materials such as gold and aluminium.

**Die**-A die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated.

**Pads**-A bonding pad serves the purpose of connecting the circuit on a die to the pin on a packaged chip

**Core**-An IP core consists of a block of logic or data that is used in a semiconductor chip. It is usually the intellectual property of a particular person or company. 
**Macros**- Also called as a custom building block

#### Basic understanding of Language and System Software

1) Application softwares-*An application, also referred to as an application program or application software, is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application.*
2) System Software-*System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs.*
    2.1) Compiler-compiler, computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C++) into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer's CPU. Compilers are very large programs, with error-checking and other abilities.
    2.2) Assembler-A software that converts an assembly language code to machine code. It takes basic Computer commands and converts them into Binary Code that Computer's Processor can use to perform its Basic Operations.
3) Hardware-*Hardware refers to the external and internal devices and equipment that enable you to perform major functions such as input, output, storage, communication, processing, and more.*
